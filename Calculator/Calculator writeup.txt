Arithmetic Calculator

As a developer, write a Java code to create a calculator to perform 
the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).


A public class named Calculator. Inside this class, 
four methods are defined: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. 
Each of these methods takes two parameters of type double (num1 and num2) 
and returns a double.

The add method returns the sum of num1 and num2.
The subtract method returns the difference of num1 and num2.
The multiply method returns the product of num1 and num2.
The divide method returns the quotient of num1 and num2

The main method is to enter the point of the program.
It creates an instance of the Calculator class and uses it to perform 
the four operations
It does not include any user input or error handling beyond the division zero check.
